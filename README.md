The mle.py contains two functions to determine:
(1) the average number of days in a year that a given city had non-zero precipitation
(2) the likelihood of precipitaiton on a given day of the year in a given city

Both functions rely on historical weather data from NOAA.

Function 1, days_of_precip, takes a city name (string) as an argument, either 'mia', 'bos', or 'jun' (for Miami, Boston, and Juneau, respectively)
Function 2, chance_of_precip, takes a city name (same three choices), a month (int), and a day (int) in that order as argument
