The mle.py contains two functions to determine:
1. The average number of days in a year that a given city had non-zero precipitation
2. The likelihood of precipitaiton on a given day of the year in a given city

Both functions rely on historical weather data from NOAA.

To run either function:
1. Function, days_of_precip, takes a city name (string) as an argument, either 'mia', 'bos', or 'jun' (for Miami, Boston, and Juneau, respectively).
2. Function, chance_of_precip, takes a city name (same three choices), a month (int), and a day (int) in that order as argument.
